HI THERE...!!!

DOUBLE CLICK ON BAT FILE, MEDIUM LEVEL WILL DEBLOAT ONLY 59 APPS FROM YOUR PHONE. BUT HARDCORE WILL DEBLOAT 66 APPS.
I RECOMMENDED YOU TO USE MEDIUM ONE. 

NOW, COPY & PASTE YOUR ADB DRIVER INSTALLED DIRECTORY. 
EXAMPLE: C:\Program Files (x86)\Minimal ADB and Fastboot

NOW CMD WILL SHOW CONNECTED DEVICE, NOW READ WHAT IS WRITTEN IN CMD AND DO THAT.

ENJOY.
